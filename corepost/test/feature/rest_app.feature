Feature: REST App
	CorePost should be able to build REST applications
	for nested REST resources

	Background:
		Given 'rest_resource' is running
		# add a few default customers
		When as user 'None:None' I POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8085/customer' with 'customerId=d1&firstName=John&lastName=Doe1'
		Then I expect HTTP code 201
		When as user 'None:None' I POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8085/customer' with 'customerId=d2&firstName=John&lastName=Doe2'
		Then I expect HTTP code 201
		When as user 'None:None' I POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8085/customer' with 'customerId=d3&firstName=John&lastName=Doe3'
		Then I expect HTTP code 201

	
	@full
	Scenario: Full Customer lifecycle
		When as user 'None:None' I GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8085/customer'
		Then I expect HTTP code 200
		And I expect JSON content
